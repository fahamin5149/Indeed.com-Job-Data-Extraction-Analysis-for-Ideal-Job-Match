<ul>
  <li><strong>Job Data Extraction Script:</strong> I developed a Python script to scrape crucial information from job listings on the Indeed website.</li>
  <li><strong>Extracted Information:</strong> The script extracts various key details from each job listing, including job titles, company names, job locations, gender preferences (if mentioned), age requirements (if specified), minimum education levels, and experience details (if available).</li>
  <li><strong>Data Organization:</strong> All extracted data is neatly organized into a structured Pandas dataframe for easy analysis and manipulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Inclusion of Links:</strong> Links to the original job listings are also included in the dataframe for reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Analysis Capability:</strong> The script enables further analysis of the job data, allowing users to filter and search for jobs based on their preferences and requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Portfolio Value:</strong> This project showcases my proficiency in web scraping using Python, data manipulation with Pandas, and the ability to extract and organize relevant information from unstructured web data. It also demonstrates my skills in creating practical tools for data analysis and decision-making.</li>
